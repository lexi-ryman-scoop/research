## Background Pattern: Sparkle Effect (NEW)

### Official Pattern
Your brand uses ONE signature pattern: **Sparkle Effect**

This pattern creates subtle "constellation" of dots in varying sizes using both Blue and Pink, suggesting intelligence, discovery, and data insights.

### Pattern Implementation

**Sparkle Pattern (Production Version):**
```css
background-color: #F8F9FA;
background-image: 
  radial-gradient(circle at 15% 25%, rgba(71, 99, 245, 0.08) 2px, transparent 2px),
  radial-gradient(circle at 45% 15%, rgba(227, 22, 91, 0.06) 1.5px, transparent 1.5px),
  radial-gradient(circle at 75% 35%, rgba(71, 99, 245, 0.1) 2.5px, transparent 2.5px),
  radial-gradient(circle at 85% 70%, rgba(71, 99, 245, 0.06) 1.5px, transparent 1.5px),
  radial-gradient(circle at 30% 65%, rgba(227, 22, 91, 0.07) 2px, transparent 2px),
  radial-gradient(circle at 60% 80%, rgba(71, 99, 245, 0.08) 1.5px, transparent 1.5px);
background-size: 80px 80px;
```

**Key Features:**
- Uses both Blue (#4763F5) and Pink (#E3165B)
- Varying dot sizes (1.5px - 2.5px)
- Scattered positioning (not a rigid grid)
- Very low opacity (6-10%) - barely visible
- Creates "intelligent discovery" feeling

### Pattern Usage Rules

**Where to Use:**
- Apply ONLY to Light Gray backgrounds (#F8F9FA)
- Use on 2-4 sections per page maximum
- Skip sections with heavy image/content density

**Where NOT to Use:**
- Never on White backgrounds (keep those clean)
- Never on Offblack backgrounds (hero/footer)
- Never on sections with lots of screenshots or images
- Never on sections with complex layouts

**Example Page Structure:**
```
Hero: Offblack (no pattern)
Stats: White (no pattern)
Problem Section: Light Gray (WITH sparkle pattern) ✓
Features: White (no pattern)
Benefits: Light Gray (WITH sparkle pattern) ✓
Social Proof: White (no pattern)
Final CTA: Light Gray (WITH sparkle pattern) ✓
Footer: Offblack (no pattern)
```

### Hero Section Pattern (Special Case)

For the hero section only, use the **Animated Dots** pattern on Offblack:

```css
background-color: #130417;
background-image: radial-gradient(circle, rgba(71, 99, 245, 0.03) 1px, transparent 1px);
background-size: 32px 32px;
animation: float 60s linear infinite;

@keyframes float {
  from { transform: translate(0, 0); }
  to { transform: translate(32px, 32px); }
}
```

This is the ONLY exception - hero gets its own subtle animated dots in blue only.

### Pattern Philosophy
**One pattern, used consistently** = cohesive brand identity. Don't mix multiple patterns or create variations. Sparkle is your signature texture.

---

## Layout Rules

### Page Structure Template (UPDATED)
```
1. Hero Section - Offblack background + animated dots (blue only)
2. Stats/Social Proof - White background (no pattern)

4. Features - White background (no pattern)
5. Benefits - Light Gray background + SPARKLE pattern ✓
6. Social Proof/Case Studies - White background (no pattern)
7. Final CTA - Light Gray background + SPARKLE pattern ✓

0px 4px 20px rgba(19, 4, 23, 0.04),
0px 12px 40px rgba(19, 4, 23, 0.02)
```

**Level 2 - Medium (featured cards, images):**
```
0px 8px 30px rgba(19, 4, 23, 0.08),
0px 20px 60px rgba(19, 4, 23, 0.04)
```

**Level 3 - Strong (hero elements, modals):**
```
0px 20px 60px rgba(19, 4, 23, 0.12),
0px 40px 100px rgba(19, 4, 23, 0.06)
```

### Creating Visual Hierarchy Through Depth

**Background Layer (-1):**
- Patterns
- Decorative shapes
- Atmospheric blurs

**Base Layer (0):**
- Page background
- Section backgrounds

**Content Layer (1):**
- Text
- Standard cards
- Images with subtle shadows

**Elevated Layer (2):**
- Featured cards
- Hero visual elements
- CTAs with hover states

**Floating Layer (3):**
- Modals
- Tooltips

### Atmospheric Effects (Offblack backgrounds only)

**Radial Blur Spots:**
```
Create depth with soft, out-of-focus color:
- Large circles (400-600px)
- Radial gradients in opacity only
- Pink or Blue at 5-8% opacity
- Heavy blur (60-80px)
- Position strategically (corners, behind content)
```

**Rules:**
- Only use on Offblack backgrounds
- Maximum 2-3 per section
- Keep opacity very low (5-8%)
- Blur heavily so they're atmospheric, not distracting

## Brand Voice & Personality

### Positioning: "Brilliant & Approachable"

**We are:**
- Confident but not arrogant

- Sterile or lifeless

### Tone Guidelines

**Headlines:**

- Show don't tell (use specific examples)
- Example: "Scoop's **Investigation Coordinator** autonomously drills into revenue declines, surfacing root causes based on your **Encoded Expertise**."

**CTAs:**
- Action verbs
- Specific outcomes
- No generic "Learn More"
- Examples: "See Your Data", "Start Analysis", "Book Demo", "Get Started"

**Avoid:**
- Superlatives (best, greatest, revolutionary)
- All caps (except tiny labels)
- Excessive exclamation points
- Buzzwords without substance
- Vague promises

---

## Visual Principles

### 1. Lightness With Energy
- Pages should feel airy and open, not heavy
- Use Pink strategically to inject energy
- White space is a feature, not empty space
- Let content breathe but don't bore

### 2. Depth Without Gradients
- Create dimension through shadows, not gradients
- Layer elements with varying shadow strengths
- Use atmospheric effects on dark backgrounds
- Patterns add texture without noise

### 3. Clarity Over Cleverness
- Function before decoration
- Every element should have clear purpose
- Remove anything that doesn't serve the user
- Simplicity with sophistication

### 4. Consistency Over Variety
- Use the same patterns throughout
- Don't introduce new styles mid-page
- Repetition builds recognition
- Establish rhythm with alternating backgrounds

### 5. Intelligence Made Visible
- Use data visualizations when possible
- Animated elements suggest AI activity
- Show the product in action
- Make abstract concepts concrete

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ DON'T:
- Use color gradients anywhere (opacity gradients OK for atmosphere)
- Stack multiple Offblack sections
- Mix Blue and Pink in the same component
- Use Pink buttons liberally (reserve for hero + final CTA)
- Cram elements together without breathing room
- Use all caps in headlines
- Use Offblack text on Offblack backgrounds
- Add borders to everything
- Use heavy/bold font weights
- Create dark, heavy pages
- Make every section white (too sterile)
- Overuse patterns (subtle is key)

### ✅ DO:
- Use solid colors with atmospheric depth on dark backgrounds
- Limit Offblack to 2 sections per page (hero + footer)
- Choose Blue OR Pink per button strategically

## Quick Reference: Background Patterns

### Sparkle Pattern (Official Brand Pattern)
Use on Light Gray backgrounds only:
```css
background-color: #F8F9FA;
background-image: 
  radial-gradient(circle at 15% 25%, rgba(71, 99, 245, 0.08) 2px, transparent 2px),
  radial-gradient(circle at 45% 15%, rgba(227, 22, 91, 0.06) 1.5px, transparent 1.5px),

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Do First)
1. Fix hero text color to White
2. Change hero CTA to Pink
3. Fix any Offblack text on Offblack backgrounds
4. Ensure proper text contrast everywhere
5. Limit page to 2 Offblack sections max

### Phase 2: Visual Enhancement
1. Add Pink accent dots to stats
2. Implement background patterns (dots and lines)
3. Add multi-layer shadows to cards
4. Create two-column hero layout
5. Add Pink numbered badges to screenshots

### Phase 3: Depth & Atmosphere
1. Add animated dot pattern to hero
2. Implement atmospheric blur effects
3. Create 3D dashboard preview
4. Add hover states with shadows
5. Implement section dividers

### Phase 4: Polish
1. Refine spacing throughout
2. Ensure consistent icon treatments
3. Optimize animations
4. Test all hover states
5. Verify accessibility contrast ratios

## Implementation Notes

### For Designers:
These are the exact specifications for creating a light, energetic, sophisticated brand. The key is balancing white space with strategic pops of color and creating depth through shadows rather than gradients.

### For Developers:
Set up your CSS variables from the Quick Reference section. Create component libraries that enforce these rules—make it impossible to create color gradients or misuse the color palette. The pattern backgrounds are simple CSS that should be applied consistently.

### For Content Creators:
Your copy should match the visual lightness—clear, confident, and benefit-focused. Avoid marketing fluff. Show concrete value with specific examples.

### For Everyone:
When you're unsure, ask yourself:
1. Is this light and approachable? (not heavy/dark)
2. Is this clear and confident? (not vague/timid)
3. Does this add depth without gradients? (shadows/patterns)
4. Am I using Pink strategically? (not everywhere)
5. Is the text readable? (white on dark, dark on light)

If yes to all, you're on brand.
