### Cold Email Sequence (3-touch)

**Email 1: The Pain Point**
```
Subject: Your HubSpot + GA + Google Ads data problem

Hi {{first_name}},

Quick question: When your CEO asks "why did conversions drop last week," how long does it take you to answer?

If you're like most marketing managers using HubSpot, Google Analytics, and Google Ads, the answer is "2-3 hours of pulling data and correlating spreadsheets."

That's what Scoop fixes. It connects all three platforms and automatically investigates anomalies—so you wake up to answers, not questions.

Worth a 14-day free trial to see how it works?

**Email 2: The Social Proof (Day 3)**
```
Subject: How marketing teams cut investigation time by 95%

{{first_name}},

Following up on my last note about connecting HubSpot, Google Analytics, and Google Ads data.

The typical marketing manager spends 2+ hours investigating when campaigns underperform. Scoop reduces that to 45 seconds—automatically correlating data across all three platforms.

No SQL. No data team requests. Just answers.

### Cold Email Sequence (3-touch)

**Email 1: The Pain Point**
```
Subject: Your Salesforce + HubSpot + BigQuery attribution problem

Hi {{first_name}},

RevOps confession time: How much of your week is spent pulling data from Salesforce, correlating it with HubSpot campaigns, and explaining the results to leadership?

Most RevOps managers I talk to say 40-60% of their time goes to "data gymnastics" rather than actual operations improvements.

Scoop connects your Salesforce, HubSpot, and BigQuery data and automatically investigates pipeline anomalies—so you spend less time pulling reports and more time fixing problems.

```

**Email 2: The Specific Use Case (Day 3)**
```
Subject: "Why did pipeline drop 15%?"

{{first_name}},

When pipeline drops 15%, how long does it take you to figure out why?

For most RevOps teams, the answer involves:
- Pulling Salesforce stage conversion data
- Correlating with HubSpot campaign performance
- Checking the warehouse for historical trends
- Building a deck to explain it

Scoop does all of that automatically—at 6am, before you open Slack.

**Email 3: The Direct Ask (Day 7)**
```
Subject: Quick question

{{first_name}},

Is connecting your Salesforce, HubSpot, and BigQuery data to automatically investigate pipeline issues something that would help?

If yes: {{link}}
If timing isn't right: No problem, just let me know.

### LinkedIn Outreach Sequence

**Connection Request:**
```
Hi {{first_name}}—I work with RevOps teams that use Salesforce + HubSpot + data warehouses. We built a tool that automatically investigates pipeline anomalies across all three. Thought it might be relevant to your work at {{company}}.
```

**Follow-up Message (Day 2 after connection):**
```
Thanks for connecting!

Quick question: How much of your week goes to "data gymnastics" vs. actual revenue operations work?

Most RevOps managers I talk to say it's 40-60% data pulling/explaining, 40-60% actual problem-solving.

We built Scoop specifically to flip that ratio—it connects Salesforce, HubSpot, and your warehouse to automatically investigate anomalies.

Free trial if you want to test it: {{link}}
```

### A/B Test Angles
- **Angle A:** Time allocation ("40-60% of your week on data gymnastics")
- **Angle B:** Proactive alerting ("At 6am, before you open Slack")
- **Angle C:** Attribution pain ("The attribution problem no one talks about")

**Email 1: The Pain Point**
```
Subject: Your best SDR's secret (it's in the data)

Hi {{first_name}},

Your top SDR closed 40% more meetings last quarter. What did they do differently?

The answer is somewhere in your Salesforce pipeline, LinkedIn outreach, and Apollo sequences—but finding it requires hours of manual analysis.

Scoop connects all three and automatically identifies winning patterns: which personas convert, which sequences work, which industries respond.

```

**Email 2: The Specific Insight (Day 3)**
```
Subject: Which prospects actually convert?

{{first_name}},

Quick question: Can you quickly answer which prospect profiles in your Salesforce pipeline have the highest conversion rate from Apollo/LinkedIn outreach?

Most sales managers can't—the data lives in three different systems.

Scoop connects Salesforce, LinkedIn, and Apollo to automatically surface patterns like:
- Which industries convert 2x better
- Which job titles respond fastest
- Which outreach sequences actually work

You shipped 12 features last quarter. Which ones actually moved retention?

Scoop does it automatically. It connects Jira, Amplitude, and your data warehouse to surface feature impact before your next sprint planning.

Scoop does it automatically and alerts you to problems before leadership even asks.
