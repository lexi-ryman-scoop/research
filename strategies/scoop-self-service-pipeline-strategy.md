# Scoop Analytics: Self-Service Pipeline Strategy

## The Problem

- **Outbound:** Volume is fine, but asking for meetings → low conversion
- **Self-service:** Free trial exists, but not enough people are discovering it
- **Traffic:** Mostly direct/referral → doesn't scale

## The Goal

Build automated discovery channels that drive **free trial signups without sales involvement**.

```
Discovery → Website → Free Trial Signup → Product Experience → Conversion
   ↑
 THIS IS THE GAP
```

## Strategy Overview

With 25+ pieces of content/week, you have the firepower to dominate SEO. Combined with Reddit, retargeting, and partnerships, here's the priority stack:

| Channel | Volume Potential | Time to Results | Your Fit |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|----------|
| **SEO/Programmatic** | HIGH | 3-6 months | Perfect - you have content capacity |
| **Reddit Organic** | MEDIUM-HIGH | 1-3 months | Good - authentic engagement works |
| **Retargeting Ads** | MEDIUM | Immediate | Good - capture existing visitors |
| **Partnerships** | MEDIUM | 3-6 months | Good - already in marketplaces |

---

## Channel 1: SEO / Programmatic Pages (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

### Why This Is Your Biggest Opportunity

- You produce 25+ pieces/week
- Your competitors (Power BI, Tableau) rank for broad terms but miss long-tail
- Integration + comparison pages have HIGH buyer intent and LOWER competition
- This compounds over time

### Page Types to Build

#### 1. Integration Pages (100+ pages)

**Target keywords:** "[Tool A] + [Tool B] integration", "connect [Tool A] to [Tool B]"

**Examples:**
- `/integrations/hubspot-google-analytics` → "HubSpot Google Analytics Integration"
- `/integrations/salesforce-slack-reporting` → "Salesforce Slack Reporting"
- `/integrations/jira-amplitude` → "Connect Jira and Amplitude Data"
- `/integrations/monday-google-sheets` → "Monday.com Google Sheets Integration"

**Template structure:**
```
1. H1: Connect [Tool A] + [Tool B] with Scoop
2. Pain point intro (2-3 sentences)
3. How Scoop connects these tools (with screenshot)
4. Use cases (3 bullet points)
5. How it works (3 steps)
6. CTA: Start free trial
```

**Priority integrations (based on your ICP segments):**

| Segment | Integration Combo | Search Volume Est. |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| Marketing | HubSpot + Google Analytics | Medium |
| Marketing | Google Ads + Google Analytics | High |
| RevOps | Salesforce + HubSpot | High |
| Sales | Salesforce + LinkedIn | Medium |
| Product | Jira + Amplitude | Low-Medium |
| Ops | Monday.com + Airtable | Medium |
| Ops | Airtable + Google Sheets | Medium |

**Volume target:** 10-15 integration pages/week → 50+ in first month

---

#### 2. Comparison Pages (30+ pages)

**Target keywords:** "[Competitor] alternative", "[Competitor] vs [Competitor]", "best [category] tool"

**Examples:**
- `/compare/scoop-vs-julius-ai` → "Scoop vs Julius AI"
- `/compare/scoop-vs-power-bi` → "Scoop vs Power BI for Non-Technical Teams"
- `/compare/tableau-alternatives` → "Tableau Alternatives for Mid-Market"
- `/compare/best-ai-analytics-tools` → "Best AI Analytics Tools 2025"

**Template structure:**
```
1. H1: [Competitor] vs Scoop Analytics (or "[Competitor] Alternatives")
2. Quick comparison table (features, pricing, best for)
3. Detailed feature breakdown
4. Where Scoop wins (Domain Intelligence, no SQL, Slack-native)
5. Where [Competitor] wins (be honest - builds trust)
6. Who should use what
7. CTA: Try Scoop free
```

**Priority competitors:**
1. Julius AI (direct competitor, similar positioning)
2. Power BI (incumbent, price-sensitive buyers searching alternatives)
3. Tableau (enterprise, mid-market looking for simpler option)
4. Looker (Google ecosystem users)
5. Metabase (open source users looking to upgrade)
6. ThoughtSpot (AI analytics comparison)
7. Domo (mid-market BI)

**Volume target:** 3-5 comparison pages/week → 15+ in first month

---

#### 3. Use Case Pages (50+ pages)

**Target keywords:** "how to [job to be done]", "[role] analytics", "[industry] reporting"

**Examples:**
- `/use-cases/marketing-campaign-analysis` → "Marketing Campaign Analysis Without SQL"
- `/use-cases/sales-pipeline-reporting` → "Automated Sales Pipeline Reporting"
- `/use-cases/operations-project-tracking` → "Operations Project Tracking Dashboard"
- `/use-cases/ecommerce-analytics` → "E-commerce Analytics for Non-Technical Teams"

**Template structure:**
```
1. H1: [Use Case] with Scoop
2. The problem (why this is hard today)
3. How Scoop solves it (with screenshots/demo)
4. Example insight Scoop would surface
5. How to get started (3 steps)
6. CTA: Start free trial
```

**Priority by segment:**
- Marketing: Campaign analysis, attribution, funnel analysis
- Sales: Pipeline reporting, forecast accuracy, rep performance
- RevOps: Cross-system reporting, data reconciliation
- Product: Feature impact, user behavior analysis
- Operations: Project tracking, resource utilization, budget monitoring

**Volume target:** 5-7 use case pages/week → 25+ in first month

---

#### 4. "How To" Content (Ongoing)

**Target keywords:** "how to [specific task]", "[tool] reporting", "analyze [data type]"

**Examples:**
- "How to connect HubSpot and Google Analytics without code"
- "How to build a sales dashboard without SQL"
- "How to analyze marketing campaign performance"
- "How to automate Salesforce reporting to Slack"

**These should link to relevant integration/use case pages.**

## Channel 2: Reddit Organic

### Why Reddit Works for Self-Service

- People ask questions → you provide value → they check you out
- No "friendlies" needed (unlike Product Hunt)
- 75% of B2B decision-makers influenced by Reddit
- Long-tail: answers rank in Google for years

### Target Subreddits

| Subreddit | Members | Your Angle |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| r/analytics | 120k+ | Answer "how do I analyze X" questions |
| r/BusinessIntelligence | 45k+ | Discuss BI tool frustrations, alternatives |
| r/salesforce | 70k+ | Help with Salesforce reporting pain points |
| r/marketing | 1.6M | Marketing analytics, campaign analysis |
| r/datascience | 1.5M | Position as no-code alternative |
| r/smallbusiness | 2M+ | Analytics for non-technical operators |
| r/startups | 1.2M | Startup analytics stack discussions |
| r/hubspot | 8k+ | HubSpot reporting limitations |
| r/SaaS | 100k+ | SaaS analytics, founder discussions |

### Reddit Playbook

**Phase 1: Build Credibility (Week 1-2)**

1. Create account (or use existing personal account)
2. Subscribe to all target subreddits
3. Comment helpfully on 5-10 posts/day
4. DO NOT mention Scoop yet
5. Build to 100+ karma

**Phase 2: Value-First Engagement (Week 3+)**

1. Answer questions with genuinely useful responses
2. If directly relevant, mention "we built something for this" with link
3. Share insights without pitching: "I analyzed 50 companies' marketing stacks..."
4. Upvote/engage with others' good content

**Example Responses:**

*Question: "What's the best way to combine HubSpot and Google Analytics data?"*

> Good answer: "The main options are: (1) Export both to a spreadsheet and manually combine - works but doesn't scale, (2) Use a tool like Fivetran to sync to a warehouse then query with SQL - powerful but needs technical skills, (3) Use an analytics platform that connects both natively - tools like Scoop, Julius AI, or similar can pull from both and let you ask questions directly. Depends on your technical comfort level and budget."

*Question: "Our Salesforce reports are a mess. Any suggestions?"*

> Good answer: "Few questions - what specifically is messy? Data quality, report building, or getting insights? For data quality, start with validation rules and required fields. For reports, Salesforce's native reporting is clunky - many teams export to Excel or use a BI layer. For insights, depends if you have someone technical or need something more plug-and-play."

**What NOT to Do:**
- Don't create new account and immediately post about Scoop
- Don't copy-paste the same response
- Don't post promotional content as a "discussion"
- Don't ignore subreddit rules

### Reddit Content Ideas

**Posts that work (after building karma):**

1. "I analyzed 100 companies' marketing data workflows - here's what efficient teams do differently"
2. "The hidden cost of dashboard maintenance (and what to do about it)"
3. "Why most BI implementations fail (from someone who's seen 50+)"
4. "AMA: I've helped 30+ mid-market companies set up analytics - ask me anything"

**Volume:** 3-5 valuable comments/day, 1-2 posts/week (after karma built)

## Channel 3: Retargeting Ads

### Why Retargeting for Self-Service

- You're already getting direct/referral traffic
- Most visitors don't convert on first visit (97%+)
- Retargeting keeps you top of mind
- Lower cost than cold acquisition ads
- Drives back to free trial (not meeting request)

### Retargeting Setup

**Pixel Installation:**
- Google Ads remarketing tag
- LinkedIn Insight Tag
- Meta Pixel (if B2B relevant)

**Audience Segments:**

| Audience | Definition | Ad Message |
|----------|------------|------------|
| All visitors | Visited any page, no signup | "See why teams ditch spreadsheets for Scoop" |
| Pricing page visitors | Visited /pricing, no signup | "Start your free trial - no credit card" |
| Integration page visitors | Visited /integrations/*, no signup | "Connect [Tool] + [Tool] in minutes" |
| Blog readers | Read 2+ blog posts | "Ready to try what you've been reading about?" |
| Trial drop-offs | Started signup, didn't complete | "Your free trial is waiting" |

**Ad Creative:**

1. **Testimonial-style** (even without reviews, use quotes from conversations):
   - "Finally, analytics I can actually use" - [Role], [Company size]

2. **Pain point → solution:**
   - "Tired of waiting for the data team? Scoop answers questions in seconds."

3. **Social proof via metrics:**
   - "100+ data sources. One question. Instant insights."

4. **Demo/walkthrough:**
   - Short video showing Scoop answering a question

**Budget Allocation:**

| Platform | % of Budget | Why |
|----------|-------------|-----|
| Google Display | 40% | Broad reach, lower CPM |
| LinkedIn | 40% | B2B targeting, higher intent |
| Meta | 20% | Test, may work for SMB segment |

**Recommended starting budget:** $500-1,000/month for retargeting only

## Channel 4: Partnerships / Integrations

### Leverage Existing Marketplace Presence

You're already on Salesforce AppExchange and HubSpot Marketplace. Optimize these:

**Salesforce AppExchange:**
- [ ] Optimize listing title and description for search within AppExchange
- [ ] Add screenshots showing Salesforce-specific use cases
- [ ] Request reviews from any Salesforce-using trials (even if informal)
- [ ] Create Salesforce-specific landing page for AppExchange traffic

**HubSpot Marketplace:**
- [ ] Same optimization as above
- [ ] HubSpot has active community - engage there
- [ ] Create HubSpot-specific content for your blog

### New Partnership Opportunities

**Tier 1: Listing Marketplaces (Low Effort)**

| Marketplace | Relevance | Effort |
|-------------|-----------|--------|
| Slack App Directory | HIGH - you're Slack-native | Medium |
| Google Workspace Marketplace | HIGH - Sheets users | Medium |
| Airtable Universe | MEDIUM - Ops segment | Low |
| Zapier | MEDIUM - automation users | Low |
| n8n | LOW-MEDIUM - technical users | Low |

**Tier 2: Co-Marketing Partners (Medium Effort)**

Target: Companies with complementary tools and similar ICP

- **Data sources you connect to:** Partner with tools in your integration list
- **Agencies/consultants:** RevOps agencies, HubSpot partners, Salesforce consultants
- **Content partners:** Swap guest posts, joint webinars

**Partnership Outreach Template:**

> Subject: Quick partnership idea - [Their Tool] + Scoop
>
> Hey [Name],
>
> I'm [Your name] at Scoop Analytics. We connect to [Their Tool] and have a bunch of users in common.
>
> Quick idea: We could do a joint piece on "[Use case combining both tools]" - we'd promote to our audience, you'd promote to yours.
>
> Interested in a 15-min chat to see if it makes sense?
