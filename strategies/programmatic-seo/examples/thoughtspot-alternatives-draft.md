## Why Users Look for ThoughtSpot Alternatives

ThoughtSpot pioneered search-based analytics, but many teams hit limitations:

**Enterprise Pricing**
ThoughtSpot's pricing is enterprise-only with custom quotes typically starting at $100,000+/year. Smaller teams are priced out entirely.

**IT-Maintained Semantic Layers**
Despite the "self-service" promise, ThoughtSpot requires IT to build and maintain semantic models. When business users need new metrics, they're back to waiting on data teams.

**Complex Implementation**
ThoughtSpot deployments typically take 3-6 months. The platform requires significant data preparation and ongoing maintenance.

**Limited Investigation Depth**
ThoughtSpot excels at answering simple questions but struggles with multi-step investigations. Users can't easily follow up on initial findings.
