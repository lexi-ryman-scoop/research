## Why Users Look for Sisense Alternatives

Sisense excels at embedded analytics but struggles with internal BI:

**Low Business User Autonomy**
With a BUA score of just 28/100, Sisense requires heavy IT involvement. Business users can't self-serve effectively.

**Complex Implementation**
Sisense deployments require significant technical resources. Expect months of implementation before seeing value.

**Embedded Focus**
Sisense is built for embedding analytics in products. If you need internal BI, you're using a tool optimized for a different use case.

**Enterprise Pricing**
Custom pricing with enterprise sales cycles. Smaller teams often can't get budget approval.
