## Why Users Look for Qlik Alternatives

Qlik's associative engine is powerful, but many teams struggle with:

**Low User Adoption**
Qlik mobile apps see just 5% adoption after six months. The complexity barrier keeps business users from engaging.

**IT Dependency**
Users can't investigate without IT building new data models first. Self-service is more marketing than reality.

**Complex Interface**
Qlik Sense requires significant training. Creating meaningful analyses takes expertise most business users don't have.

**High Total Cost**
Between licensing, implementation, and ongoing IT support, Qlik's total cost often exceeds budget.
