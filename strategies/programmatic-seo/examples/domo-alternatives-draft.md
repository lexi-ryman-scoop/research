## Why Users Look for Domo Alternatives

Domo is feature-rich but comes with significant trade-offs:

**High Total Cost**
Domo's enterprise pricing is notoriously expensive. With per-user fees, implementation costs, and required professional services, total cost often exceeds expectations.

**Feature Bloat**
Domo tries to do everything—BI, data integration, app building, collaboration. Many teams only use 20% of features but pay for 100%.

**Complexity**
The platform's breadth creates a steep learning curve. Basic tasks that should be simple require training and expertise.

**Limited AI Investigation**
Despite marketing claims, Domo's AI features are surface-level. Business users still depend on pre-built dashboards and IT-created metrics.
