# Scoop Analytics: The Domain Intelligence Platform
*Beyond Dashboards - Autonomous Investigation at Enterprise Scale*
*October 29, 2025*

## Executive Overview

Scoop Analytics is the world's first Domain Intelligence platform - a revolutionary system that encodes executive expertise, scales it across entire organizations through autonomous investigation, and learns from your team's usage. While traditional BI tools show static dashboards and generic AI knows nothing about your business, Scoop investigates why things happened, what they mean, and what to do about them - with intelligence that improves from 70% to 95%+ accuracy through natural usage.

In a 4-5 hour configuration session, we capture decades of executive expertise - the patterns you look for, the thresholds that matter, the investigations you perform. This intelligence then runs 24/7 across your entire operation, conducting sophisticated multi-hypothesis investigations while learning your specific terminology and patterns through optional feedback. You wake up to completed investigations that get smarter every day.

## The Domain Intelligence Revolution

### What Makes Domain Intelligence Different

**Traditional BI (PowerBI, Tableau, Looker)**:
- Shows dashboards of what happened
- Requires manual investigation
- Generic, knows nothing about your business
- Static thresholds and alerts
- You ask questions, it shows data

**Domain Intelligence (Scoop)**:
- Investigates why things happened automatically
- Provides root causes and recommendations
- Encoded with YOUR business expertise
- Dynamic, context-aware investigation
- Finds insights before you ask

### Real-World Example: EZ Corp Pawn Shops

**The Challenge**: 1,279 stores, 196 data columns, COO can only review 20% daily

**The Solution**: 4-hour session with COO Blair captured his investigation patterns

**Initial Result**: Domain Intelligence investigating all stores at 70% accuracy

**Learning Journey**:
- Week 1: "Origination rate" returned 1.42% (generic calculation)
- Feedback: "Should be ~93%"
- System learned EZCorp's specific definition
- Now: 95% accuracy with 200+ business terms correctly understood

**Current State**: Domain Intelligence now investigates all stores with expertise:
- "Store 523 PLO down 25%" → Automatic investigation of customer segments, redemption patterns, category mix
- Identifies that 35% drop in 25-34 age segment drove decline
- Discovers stores 541-543 can offset with 30% more loans at same risk
- All 1,279 stores investigated with improving accuracy daily

- **Direct Corrections**: Users can provide specific, natural language corrections (e.g., "Our 'loan origination rate' should be calculated as X, not Y").
- **Schema Refinement**: These corrections are automatically absorbed and used to refine the Encoded Expertise (Schema v2.8), preventing future errors and ensuring perfect alignment with your business rules.
- **Eliminate Hallucinations**: By leveraging user-provided ground truth, Scoop maintains deterministic accuracy and eliminates the probabilistic guesswork common in generic AI.

This unique feedback system ensures that Scoop becomes progressively smarter and more precise with every interaction, making your Domain Intelligence truly evolutionary.

## The Domain Intelligence Vision

We believe every organization has deep expertise trapped in the minds of a few senior executives. These leaders know what patterns to look for, what thresholds matter, what investigations to perform. But they can only be in one place at a time, reviewing a fraction of their business.

Domain Intelligence changes this fundamental limitation. By encoding executive expertise once, we scale it infinitely. Your best thinking, everywhere, always.

This isn't about replacing human intelligence - it's about multiplying it. Your executives focus on strategy while their encoded expertise handles investigation. Your dashboards show what's happening while Domain Intelligence explains why and what to do.

The future of business intelligence isn't better dashboards or generic AI. It's your own expertise, scaled infinitely through Domain Intelligence.
