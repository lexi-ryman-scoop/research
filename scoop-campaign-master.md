**Email 1: The Pain Point (Day 1)**
```
Subject: Your HubSpot + GA + Google Ads data problem

Hi {{first_name}},

Quick question: When your CEO asks "why did conversions drop last week," how long does it take you to answer?

If you're like most marketing managers using HubSpot, Google Analytics, and Google Ads, the answer is "2-3 hours of pulling data and correlating spreadsheets."

That's what Scoop fixes. It connects all three platforms and automatically investigates anomalies—so you wake up to answers, not questions.

Worth a 14-day free trial to see how it works?

**Email 2: The Social Proof (Day 4)**
```
Subject: How marketing teams cut investigation time by 95%

{{first_name}},

Following up on my last note about connecting HubSpot, Google Analytics, and Google Ads data.

The typical marketing manager spends 2+ hours investigating when campaigns underperform. Scoop reduces that to 45 seconds—automatically correlating data across all three platforms.

No SQL. No data team requests. Just answers.

#### Cold Email Sequence (3-touch)

**Email 1: The Pain Point (Day 1)**
```
Subject: Your Salesforce + HubSpot + BigQuery attribution problem

Hi {{first_name}},

RevOps confession time: How much of your week is spent pulling data from Salesforce, correlating it with HubSpot campaigns, and explaining the results to leadership?

Most RevOps managers I talk to say 40-60% of their time goes to "data gymnastics" rather than actual operations improvements.

Scoop connects your Salesforce, HubSpot, and BigQuery data and automatically investigates pipeline anomalies—so you spend less time pulling reports and more time fixing problems.

```

**Email 2: The Specific Use Case (Day 4)**
```
Subject: "Why did pipeline drop 15%?"

{{first_name}},

When pipeline drops 15%, how long does it take you to figure out why?

For most RevOps teams, the answer involves:
- Pulling Salesforce stage conversion data
- Correlating with HubSpot campaign performance
- Checking the warehouse for historical trends
- Building a deck to explain it

Scoop does all of that automatically—at 6am, before you open Slack.

```
Subject: Your best SDR's secret (it's in the data)

Hi {{first_name}},

Your top SDR closed 40% more meetings last quarter. What did they do differently?

The answer is somewhere in your Salesforce pipeline, LinkedIn outreach, and Apollo sequences—but finding it requires hours of manual analysis.

Scoop connects all three and automatically identifies winning patterns: which personas convert, which sequences work, which industries respond.

Subject: Which prospects actually convert?

{{first_name}},

Quick question: Can you quickly answer which prospect profiles in your Salesforce pipeline have the highest conversion rate from Apollo/LinkedIn outreach?

Most sales managers can't—the data lives in three different systems.

Scoop connects Salesforce, LinkedIn, and Apollo to automatically surface patterns like:
- Which industries convert 2x better
- Which job titles respond fastest
- Which outreach sequences actually work

- Use TheirStack to find companies hiring for "Amplitude analyst" or "data engineer BigQuery"

**Step 3:** Import company list to Apollo and filter by PM titles

**Alternative:** Use Amplitude community lists, Atlassian user groups, or Amplify conference attendee lists

#### Cold Email Sequence (3-touch)

**Email 1: The Pain Point (Day 1)**
```
Subject: Did your last release actually improve retention?

Hi {{first_name}},

You shipped 12 features last quarter. Which ones actually moved retention?

The answer requires correlating your Jira tickets with Amplitude behavior data and warehouse metrics—usually a multi-day analysis project.

Scoop does it automatically. It connects Jira, Amplitude, and your data warehouse to surface feature impact before your next sprint planning.

## Alternative List Building Methods

### Method 1: Job Posting Mining (Best for Internal Tools)

**Tools:**
| Tool | Cost | Best For |
|------|------|----------|
| **TheirStack** | $0.11/company | Budget-friendly tech detection via job posts |
| **Bloomberry** | $199/mo | Premium job post analysis for tech stacks |
| **LinkedIn Jobs** | Free (manual) | Search tech names in job descriptions |

**Process:**
1. Search LinkedIn Jobs for "[Technology] engineer" or "[Technology] analyst"
2. Note the companies hiring for those roles
3. Import company domains to Apollo
4. Filter by your target job titles

**Example Searches:**
- `"Snowflake" AND "data engineer"` → Companies using Snowflake
- `"Amplitude" AND "product analyst"` → Companies using Amplitude
- `"BigQuery" AND "analytics"` → Companies using BigQuery

### Method 2: Apollo Company Keywords Filter

Use the **Company Keywords** filter (under Industry & Keywords) to find companies mentioning technologies:

```
Company Keywords: "Snowflake", "BigQuery", "Amplitude", "data warehouse"
Keyword Types: ☑ Keywords (curated from websites/social)
              ☑ Company Description
```

### Method 3: BuiltWith + Apollo Enrichment

For front-end technologies, use BuiltWith for detection, then Apollo for contacts:

1. **BuiltWith** → Export list of domains using HubSpot + Google Analytics + Google Ads
2. **Apollo** → Import domains → Enrich with contacts → Filter by title

### Method 4: Community Lists

| Technology | Community Source |
|------------|------------------|
| Snowflake | Snowflake Summit, Snowflake Community |
| Amplitude | Amplify conference, Amplitude Slack |
| BigQuery | Google Cloud Next |
| Jira | Atlassian Team conference |
| HubSpot | INBOUND conference |
