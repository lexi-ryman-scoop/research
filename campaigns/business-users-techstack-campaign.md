**Email 1: The Pain Point (Day 1)**
```
Subject: Your HubSpot + GA + Google Ads data problem

Hi {{first_name}},

Quick question: When your CEO asks "why did conversions drop last week," how long does it take you to answer?

If you're like most marketing managers using HubSpot, Google Analytics, and Google Ads, the answer is "2-3 hours of pulling data and correlating spreadsheets."

That's what Scoop fixes. It connects all three platforms and automatically investigates anomalies—so you wake up to answers, not questions.

Worth a 14-day free trial to see how it works?

**Email 2: The Social Proof (Day 4)**
```
Subject: How marketing teams cut investigation time by 95%

{{first_name}},

Following up on my last note about connecting HubSpot, Google Analytics, and Google Ads data.

The typical marketing manager spends 2+ hours investigating when campaigns underperform. Scoop reduces that to 45 seconds—automatically correlating data across all three platforms.

No SQL. No data team requests. Just answers.

Hi {{first_name}},

Real talk: How many browser tabs do you have open right now?

If you're like most ops managers I talk to, it's Monday.com for project status, Airtable for resource allocation, and Google Sheets for budgets—all disconnected.

Scoop connects all three and automatically flags delays, budget overruns, and resource conflicts before they become client emergencies.

Subject: Your TikTok + Google attribution problem

Hi {{first_name}},

TikTok says your video went viral. Google says conversions are down. GA says bounce rate is up.

Which platform is telling the truth?

If you're running DTC campaigns across TikTok and Google, you know attribution is basically broken. Each platform takes credit, but none of them show the full picture.

Scoop connects Google Analytics, Google Ads, and TikTok data and automatically investigates what's actually driving revenue—not what each platform wants you to believe.

Subject: Which campaigns actually drive revenue?

{{first_name}},

Quick question: Can you confidently say which of your TikTok campaigns actually drove purchases last month vs. which ones just drove clicks that converted via Google?

Most e-commerce marketers can't—because the data lives in three different platforms with three different attribution models.

```
Subject: Managing Salesforce + HubSpot + Pipedrive?

Hi {{first_name}},

If you're managing multiple CRMs—Salesforce, HubSpot, and Pipedrive—you know the pain of fragmented data.

Sales wants one report. Marketing wants another. Leadership wants a unified view. And you're stuck manually reconciling data across all three systems.

Scoop connects all your CRMs and automatically surfaces pipeline anomalies, data discrepancies, and opportunities you'd otherwise miss.

**Email 2: The Specific Use Case (Day 4)**
```
Subject: One view across all your CRMs

{{first_name}},

How long does it take you to answer: "What's the real pipeline number across all our systems?"

When deals live in Salesforce, HubSpot, AND Pipedrive, getting a single source of truth usually means hours of exports and spreadsheet reconciliation.

Scoop does it automatically—connecting all three CRMs and investigating discrepancies before leadership asks.

**Email 1: The Pain Point (Day 1)**
```
Subject: Your agency's profitability blind spot

Hi {{first_name}},

That client looks profitable in HubSpot. But is it really?

If you're like most agency owners, your sales pipeline is in HubSpot, project delivery is in Airtable, and financial tracking is in Sheets. By the time you realize a project is over scope, you've already eaten the margin.

Scoop connects all three and automatically flags profitability issues before they become problems.

```
Subject: Which clients are actually profitable?

{{first_name}},

Quick question: Can you quickly answer which of your clients are actually profitable after accounting for scope creep and overdelivery?

Most agency owners can't—because sales data (HubSpot), delivery data (Airtable), and financial data (Sheets) live in different systems.

Scoop connects them all and surfaces the real profitability picture automatically.
