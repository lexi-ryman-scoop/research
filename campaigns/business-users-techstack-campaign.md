#### Cold Email Sequence (3-touch)

**Email 1: The Pain Point (Day 1)**
```
Subject: Why did conversions drop last Tuesday?

Hi {{first_name}},

That's the kind of question that takes most marketing teams 2-3 hours to answer—pulling exports from HubSpot, GA, and Google Ads, then hunting through spreadsheets for patterns.

Scoop is an AI analyst that investigates for you. Ask "why did conversions drop?" and it analyzes your HubSpot, GA, and Google Ads data simultaneously—testing hypotheses, going 3 layers deep, and returning something like:

"Conversions dropped 23% because your top ad set exhausted budget at 2pm while CPCs spiked 40% from a competitor entering the auction."

That's the answer. In 45 seconds. No digging.

**Email 2: The Insight (Day 4)**
```
Subject: The insights you're not finding

{{first_name}},

Here's what's wild: 87% of insights Scoop surfaces are ones teams say they "never would have found."

Not because the data wasn't there—it was sitting in HubSpot, GA, and Google Ads the whole time. But manually correlating three platforms to find root causes? Nobody has time for that.

Scoop does. It's an AI analyst that investigates your data 24/7—forming hypotheses, testing them, and surfacing patterns humans miss.

One customer found $3.2M in revenue opportunities hiding in their existing data.

### Segment 2: E-commerce / DTC Marketing Managers
**Tech Stack:** `Google Analytics` + `Google AdWords Conversion` + `TikTok`

**Research Basis:** Cross-channel attribution between TikTok (awareness) and Google (conversion) is the #1 challenge for DTC marketers. TikTok drives discovery but Google captures the conversion—making true ROAS impossible to calculate with native platform reporting.

#### Target Profile
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Persona** | E-commerce Manager, DTC Marketing Manager, Performance Marketing Manager, Growth Manager, Head of E-commerce |
| **Company Size** | 20-500 employees |
| **Pain Point** | Each platform takes credit for conversions; can't determine true ROAS when TikTok drives awareness but Google captures the sale |
| **Unique Use Case** | Cross-platform attribution: understanding which TikTok campaigns actually drive revenue vs. which ones just drive clicks that convert via Google |

**Email 1: The Pain Point (Day 1)**
```
Subject: TikTok takes credit. Google takes credit. Who's lying?

Hi {{first_name}},

TikTok says your video drove 50K views. Google says it drove the conversions. GA says bounce rate is up.

They can't all be right.

Scoop is an AI analyst that investigates your actual customer journey—not what each platform wants you to believe. Ask "which TikTok campaigns actually drive purchases?" and it analyzes GA, Google Ads, and TikTok data simultaneously, then tells you something like:

"TikTok campaign X drives awareness but 73% of those users convert via branded Google search within 48 hours. True ROAS is 4.2x, not 1.1x."

That's the real story. In 45 seconds.

**Email 2: The Insight (Day 4)**
```
Subject: Your best TikTok campaign might be a Google campaign

{{first_name}},

Here's a pattern Scoop keeps finding for DTC brands:

The TikTok campaigns that look worst in TikTok's dashboard are often the best revenue drivers—because they create demand that converts via Google 2-3 days later.

But you'd never know that from looking at each platform's reports.

Scoop investigates the full journey across GA, Google Ads, and TikTok. It tests hypotheses automatically, finds the hidden attribution paths, and shows you where your budget is actually working.

### Segment 3: Product Managers (Product-Led Sales)
**Tech Stack:** `Jira` + `Google Analytics` + `Salesforce`

**Research Basis:** Jira has 53% usage among product teams for sprint/project tracking. Product-led sales (PLS) is the dominant go-to-market trend for SaaS companies—connecting product engagement signals to sales outcomes. PMs need to understand which features drive user engagement and ultimately revenue.

#### Target Profile

|-----------|--------|
| **Persona** | Product Manager, Senior Product Manager, Director of Product, Head of Product, VP Product |
| **Company Size** | 50-500 employees |
| **Pain Point** | Can't connect sprint work (Jira) to user engagement (Google Analytics) to revenue outcomes (Salesforce); "Did that feature drive engagement and deals?" |
| **Unique Use Case** | Feature-to-revenue analysis—connecting what was built (Jira) to how users engage (Google Analytics) to sales outcomes like expansion and churn (Salesforce) |

**Email 1: The Pain Point (Day 1)**
```
Subject: Did that feature drive expansion—or churn?

Hi {{first_name}},

You shipped it. Users adopted it. But what happened to revenue?

That's the question PMs at product-led companies can never quite answer—because the data lives in three places: Jira (what you built), GA (how users engaged), and Salesforce (what happened to deals).

Scoop is an AI analyst that investigates that question for you. Ask "which features correlate with expansion?" and it analyzes all three systems simultaneously, then tells you something like:

"Feature X adoption correlates with 2.3x higher expansion rate. Users who engage within 7 days of release have 67% lower churn."

That's the insight. In 45 seconds. No SQL, no exports, no waiting on the data team.

**Email 2: The Insight (Day 4)**
```
Subject: The feature-revenue connection nobody tracks

{{first_name}},

Here's what Scoop keeps finding for product-led teams:

The features that look best in adoption dashboards aren't always the ones driving revenue. Sometimes the "meh" features are the ones that correlate with expansion and retention—you just couldn't see it because the data was spread across Jira, GA, and Salesforce.

Scoop investigates these connections automatically. It forms hypotheses, tests statistical significance, and surfaces patterns humans miss.

87% of insights are ones teams say they "never would have found."

### Segment 4: RevOps Leaders
**Tech Stack:** `Salesforce` + `HubSpot` + `Snowflake`

**Research Basis:** The "modern revenue stack" consolidates CRM data (Salesforce for sales, HubSpot for marketing) into a single data warehouse (Snowflake). This is the #1 RevOps architecture trend—unifying the customer journey from first touch (HubSpot) through closed-won (Salesforce) with Snowflake as the single source of truth.

| **Persona** | Revenue Operations Manager, Director of RevOps, VP Revenue Operations, Head of RevOps, GTM Operations |
| **Company Size** | 100-500 employees |

**Email 1: The Pain Point (Day 1)**
```
Subject: Why did pipeline drop 15% last month?

Hi {{first_name}},

That's the question that takes most RevOps teams days to answer—pulling HubSpot data, reconciling with Salesforce, querying Snowflake, and building spreadsheets until the picture comes into focus.

Scoop is an AI analyst that investigates that question in 45 seconds.

Ask "why did pipeline drop?" and it analyzes HubSpot, Salesforce, and Snowflake simultaneously—testing hypotheses, going 3 layers deep, and returning something like:

"Pipeline dropped 15% due to 40% decline in enterprise segment. Root cause: MQL-to-SQL conversion fell from 23% to 12% after the website redesign on March 3rd."

That's the answer. With statistical confidence. No exports, no reconciliation, no waiting.

**Email 2: The Insight (Day 4)**
```
Subject: The funnel leaks you're not seeing

{{first_name}},

Here's what Scoop keeps finding for RevOps teams:

The pipeline problems that look like "sales issues" are often marketing issues 6 weeks earlier. And the "marketing problems" are sometimes pricing or product issues that surface in the data but get missed because the analysis is too manual.

Scoop investigates across HubSpot, Salesforce, and Snowflake automatically. It forms hypotheses, tests significance, and goes 3 layers deep to find root causes—not just symptoms.

87% of insights are ones teams say they "never would have found."

Subject: That client looks profitable. Is it?

Hi {{first_name}},

In HubSpot, the deal looks great. But by the time you reconcile Airtable hours and QuickBooks invoices, the margin's gone.

Sound familiar?

Scoop is an AI analyst that investigates profitability across all three systems. Ask "which clients are actually profitable?" and it analyzes HubSpot, Airtable, and QuickBooks simultaneously—then tells you something like:

"Client X shows 40% margin in HubSpot but actual margin is 12% after scope creep. 67% of overages come from the strategy phase. Similar pattern on 4 other accounts."

That's the insight. In 45 seconds. Before you've eaten the margin.

**Email 2: The Insight (Day 4)**

Subject: The clients killing your margin

{{first_name}},

Here's what Scoop keeps finding for agencies:

The clients that look best in your sales pipeline are often the ones killing your margin—because scope creep and overdelivery happen in Airtable, but you don't see the damage until QuickBooks. By then it's too late.

Scoop investigates profitability across HubSpot, Airtable, and QuickBooks automatically. It finds patterns humans miss—like which project types always run over, which account managers consistently over-scope, which clients negotiate hard then demand more.

87% of insights are ones teams say they "never would have found."
