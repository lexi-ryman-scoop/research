#### Cold Email Sequence (3-touch)

**Email 1: The Pain Point (Day 1)**
```
Subject: Your HubSpot + GA + Google Ads data problem

Hi {{first_name}},

Quick question: When your CEO asks "why did conversions drop last week," how long does it take you to answer?

If you're like most marketing managers using HubSpot, Google Analytics, and Google Ads, the answer is "2-3 hours of pulling data and correlating spreadsheets."

That's what Scoop fixes. It connects all three platforms and automatically investigates anomalies—so you wake up to answers, not questions.

Worth a 14-day free trial to see how it works?

**Email 2: The Social Proof (Day 4)**
```
Subject: How marketing teams cut investigation time by 95%

{{first_name}},

Following up on my last note about connecting HubSpot, Google Analytics, and Google Ads data.

The typical marketing manager spends 2+ hours investigating when campaigns underperform. Scoop reduces that to 45 seconds—automatically correlating data across all three platforms.

No SQL. No data team requests. Just answers.

### Segment 2: E-commerce / DTC Marketing Managers
**Tech Stack:** `Google Analytics` + `Google AdWords Conversion` + `TikTok`

**Research Basis:** Cross-channel attribution between TikTok (awareness) and Google (conversion) is the #1 challenge for DTC marketers. TikTok drives discovery but Google captures the conversion—making true ROAS impossible to calculate with native platform reporting.

#### Target Profile

|-----------|--------|
| **Persona** | E-commerce Manager, DTC Marketing Manager, Performance Marketing Manager, Growth Manager, Head of E-commerce |
| **Company Size** | 20-500 employees |
| **Pain Point** | Each platform takes credit for conversions; can't determine true ROAS when TikTok drives awareness but Google captures the sale |
| **Unique Use Case** | Cross-platform attribution: understanding which TikTok campaigns actually drive revenue vs. which ones just drive clicks that convert via Google |

```
Subject: Your TikTok + Google attribution problem

Hi {{first_name}},

TikTok says your video drove 50K views. Google says conversions are down. GA says bounce rate is up.

Which platform is telling the truth?

If you're running DTC campaigns across TikTok and Google, you know attribution is broken. TikTok drives awareness, but Google captures the conversion—so each platform takes credit and neither shows the full picture.

Scoop connects Google Analytics, Google Ads, and TikTok data and automatically investigates what's actually driving revenue—not what each platform wants you to believe.

```
Subject: Which campaigns actually drive revenue?

{{first_name}},

Quick question: Can you confidently say which of your TikTok campaigns actually drove purchases last month vs. which ones just drove clicks that converted via Google?

Most e-commerce marketers can't—because the data lives in three different platforms with three different attribution models.

Scoop connects them all and tells you the real story in 45 seconds.

### Segment 3: Product Managers
**Tech Stack:** `Jira` + `Amplitude` + `Snowflake`

**Research Basis:** Jira has 53% usage among product teams for sprint/project tracking. Amplitude and Snowflake have an official partnership with native integration—reflecting the trend of product teams needing behavioral analytics connected to their data warehouse. This is the dominant "modern product stack" for data-driven product teams.

#### Target Profile
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Persona** | Product Manager, Senior Product Manager, Director of Product, Head of Product, VP Product |
| **Company Size** | 50-500 employees |
| **Pain Point** | Can't connect sprint work (Jira) to user behavior (Amplitude) to business outcomes (Snowflake); "Did that feature we shipped actually move the metrics?" |
| **Unique Use Case** | Feature impact analysis—connecting what was built (Jira) to how users behave (Amplitude) to business outcomes (Snowflake) |

Subject: Did that feature actually move the metrics?

Hi {{first_name}},

You shipped the feature. The team celebrated. But did it actually work?

If you're like most PMs using Jira, Amplitude, and Snowflake, answering that question means manually correlating sprint tickets, user behavior data, and business metrics across three different systems.

Scoop connects all three and automatically investigates feature impact—so you can see what's working and what's not in 45 seconds.

{{first_name}},

Quick question: When leadership asks "what's the ROI of Q3 product investments?", how long does it take to pull that together?

Usually it means exporting Jira tickets, correlating them with Amplitude events, and joining it all in Snowflake. Hours of work.

Scoop connects all three automatically—so you can tie sprint work to user behavior to business outcomes without the manual lift.

### Segment 4: RevOps Leaders
**Tech Stack:** `Salesforce` + `HubSpot` + `Snowflake`

**Research Basis:** The "modern revenue stack" consolidates CRM data (Salesforce for sales, HubSpot for marketing) into a single data warehouse (Snowflake). This is the #1 RevOps architecture trend—unifying the customer journey from first touch (HubSpot) through closed-won (Salesforce) with Snowflake as the single source of truth.

#### Target Profile

|-----------|--------|
| **Persona** | Revenue Operations Manager, Director of RevOps, VP Revenue Operations, Head of RevOps, GTM Operations |
| **Company Size** | 100-500 employees |
| **Pain Point** | Marketing data in HubSpot, sales data in Salesforce, and leadership wants unified pipeline/revenue reporting—requires constant data reconciliation |

Subject: Your HubSpot + Salesforce + Snowflake problem

Hi {{first_name}},

Marketing lives in HubSpot. Sales lives in Salesforce. Leadership wants one number in Snowflake.

Sound familiar?

If you're like most RevOps leaders, you spend hours every week reconciling data across these three systems—chasing down discrepancies between what marketing reports, what sales reports, and what the data warehouse shows.

Scoop connects all three and automatically investigates anomalies—so you can spot funnel issues before leadership asks.

### Segment 5: Agency Owners
**Tech Stack:** `HubSpot` + `Airtable` + `QuickBooks`

**Research Basis:** The most common agency operations stack connects sales/CRM (HubSpot), project management/delivery (Airtable), and billing/finance (QuickBooks). This combination lets agencies track the full lifecycle from deal to delivery to invoice—critical for understanding true project profitability.

| **Persona** | Agency Owner, Founder, CEO, Operations Director, Managing Director |
| **Company Size** | 10-200 employees |

Subject: Your agency's profitability blind spot

Hi {{first_name}},

That client looks profitable in HubSpot. But is it really?

If you're like most agency owners, your sales pipeline is in HubSpot, project delivery is in Airtable, and invoicing is in QuickBooks. By the time you realize a project is over scope, you've already eaten the margin.

Scoop connects all three and automatically flags profitability issues—from deal to delivery to invoice—before they become problems.

{{first_name}},

Quick question: Can you quickly see which clients are actually profitable after accounting for scope creep, overdelivery, and invoicing delays?

Most agency owners can't—because deal value (HubSpot), delivery costs (Airtable), and invoiced revenue (QuickBooks) live in different systems.
